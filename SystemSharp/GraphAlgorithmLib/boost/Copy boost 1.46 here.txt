Please visit www.boost.org, download boost 1.46 and copy the contents of the "boost" folder here.

Some notes on the required version: This library was originally developed using boost version 1.46.
As I tried the more recent version 1.54 I got tons of errors which I did't find straightforward to solve.
Feel free fix to this issue... :-)
